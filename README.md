//**************************************************************************************************************************//


*This project is aimed to design and build a self balancing robot that has two operation modes:
a remote controlled mode through Bluetooth/Android phone and an autonomous mode by implementing IR sensors and actuators to avoid obstacles
The main objective of the robot is to stay upright since it's an unstable system by nature. A 6-axis gyroscope will be used to sense the orientation of the robot while a kalman filter and a PID controller will be used to achieve self-balancing. 

Hardware:

1 x TM4G123 MCU

2 x Nema 14 Bipolar Stepper Motors 

1 x HC-06 Bluetooth module

1 x MPU-6050

1 x Motor Driver made using discrete Mosfets

1 x 12 VLipo battery 

3 x FC-51 IR sensors

2 x Bumper switches

1 x Nokia LCD
